## About The Project

This application can help users consider choosing foods that produce fewer emissions. The hope is that a decrease in the purchase of high-emission foods will reduce the emissions produced, and companies will compete to produce products with lower emissions. During our research, some questions have arisen, such as whether a database of food items can be linked to their respective carbon footprint data. This question is the challenge for our group. We are interested in solving this problem because global warming has a very close impact on us. The negative effects are very tangible, such as the extremely hot and rainless conditions in our hometown for several months, leading to drought in various places.
